## Booting a microservice (might need install MongoDB and/or RabbitMQ)
    npm install
    npm start

or in development mode

    npm install
    npm run start:dev

## Booting the application
### with Docker-compose (for non production deployment)

    docker-compose up --build

Open your browser at http://localhost:4000
### with Kubernetese (Azure) with Terraform
Get details from your Azure account:

    az account show
Create a service principal, account id as subscription-id and copy appId, password:

    az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<subscription-id>"

Create a Azure storage account and then create a storage container.

Initialize and invoke Terraform, from previous stage, use appId as client_id, password as client_secret.

    cd infra
    terraform init
    terraform apply -var="app_version=<app_version>" \
                    -var="client_id=<client_id>" \
                    -var="client_secret=<client_secret>" \
                    -var="storage_account_name=<storage_account_name>" \
                    -var="storage_access_key=<storage_access_key>"


Kubernetes authenticatio (kubeconfig):

    az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your-app-name> --name <your-app-name>

Get the external IP of the gateway service

    kubectl get service


Open your browser at http://gateway-external-ip
